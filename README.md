# Comparative-Analysis-of-Deep-Learning-Models-for-Lung-Cancer-Detection-Using-CT-Scans
This project compares deep learning models like ConvNeXt, ResNeXt, SegFormer, and EfficientNet for lung cancer detection using CT scan images. It analyzes performance based on accuracy, precision, and F1-score to identify the most effective model for reliable and early diagnosis of lung cancer.
